= JS (Javascript) Reloader

JS (Javascript) Reloader is a browser extension that allows you to reload JS without reloading the page itself. It reloads all <script> tags on page. It does NOT effect in-line script.

It's currently available for Google Chrome

== Usage

Reload all scripts via the keyboard shortcut F10, or via the context-menu's option "Reload JS".

One may customize the keyboard shortcut under the extensions settings page.


=== Google Chrome
Grab the latest version for Chrome at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/js-reloader/gpmblpbhjcdbhgcekpfkdfpglplmhffo

== Limitations

JS (JavaScript) Reloader does not reload inline script.

Beware that reloading script will not update every object already loaded. One may run into interesting issues where old versions of functions are used (i.e. as callbacks/closures/exisitng objects).
